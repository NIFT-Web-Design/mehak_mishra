      <h1 class="pembarti_heading">Pembarthi Metal</h1>
      <p class="pembarti_para">Pembarthi, located at a distance of 60 Kilometers from Warangal, is famous for sheet metal art. Globally renowned for
        brassware, artefacts, metal tools and objects of daily use, statues, carvings and castings are extensively made in this
        village using copper alloys like brass and bronze.
        Andhra Pradesh has a history of outstanding workmanship of its Metalworkers or “Vishwakarma”, which can be traced
        back to the grandeur and glory of the Kakatiya Kingdom. Metal Craft attained the pinnacle of perfection in the high
        degree of skill displayed by the master craftsmen. The Vishwakaramas of Pembarthi were renowned for their rare skill,
        both in stone and metal sculpture and were patronised by the rulers for building temples, creating ‘Vigrahas’ – idols of
        the gods, ‘Vahanas’ – the chariots and other artistic accessories of temple sculpture. The brilliance of their artistry is
        evident in the magnificent Vigrahas, which are examples of moulded crafts and ‘Keerthi Mukha’, ‘Prabha’ – Pinnacles,
        which adorn many famous temples of South India.
        Brass work has become the occupation of many villagers and these wares are also exported to other countries. When
        iron use was not known copper and alloys were used for making metal tools and objects of daily use. The early social-historical skill later continuously created objects of art. Statues, carvings, and castings are still made in 
        attractive copper alloys like bronze and brass. The methods used are still ancient, traditional ones although the raw
        material today comes from modern mines and furnaces</p>

      <h1 class="pembarti_heading">Present Status</h1>
      <p class="pembarti_para">The artisans take part in welfare 
        and awareness programs for the 
        artisans. 
        100 families are practicing 
        currently, (besides Vishwakarma 
        there are other communities 
        that practice it as well).
        Online business is done 
        via Facebook, WhatsApp, 
        promotions via exhibitions.
        Adaptation of the Artisans 
        During different festivals like 
        Muharram, Mr Khalid one of 
        the pembarthi artisans gave 
        us an insight into how he 
        sells products according to 
        that particular festival, and 
        for the rest of the year, they 
        sell trophies, utensils, vases, 
        worship idols.
        Presently their main focus is 
        home decorative items as there 
        is no much demand for brass 
        utensils. 
        Instead of making devatha 
        designs on some decorative 
        products, they replaced them 
        with other designs such as birds 
        and animal designs so that the 
        products can be purchased by 
        people of different religions and 
        communities and can be sold 
        globally.
        Normally the head of the family 
        use to teach their children 
        pembarthi handicraft from the 
        age of 14-18 and then by the 
        age of 24 they use master that 
        skill, whereas now that the 
        time has changed the artisans 
        provide their children with 
        better education facilities for 
        betterment of their future.</p>
